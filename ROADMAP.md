 ## Roadmap

* Add boundary checks to the showcase
* Add tests and checks for oddball arguments to api fns, including throwing when calendar does not exist (add, holiday?, non-business-day? business-day?)
* Add a cljs perftest run
* Adicionar uma fn holidays na api, pra retornar holidays daquela data 
* Improve docs to show how to use the holi api with strings instead of LocalDate instances (except for `add`?)
