## Roadmap

* Support multi-observance rule (i.e. Christmas Day + Boxing Day in the UK - https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/uk/2027?hol=9)
* Improve the API
* Make defining your own calendars optional, so people don't need to generate a jar file
* Improve README/docs after this
* Support cljs
* Non-saturday/sunday weekends
