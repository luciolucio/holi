 ## Roadmap

* Add boundary checks to the showcase
* Throw when calendar does not exist (add, holiday?, non-business-day? business-day?)
* Adicionar uma fn holidays na api, pra retornar holidays daquela data 
* Improve docs to show how to use the holi api with strings instead of LocalDate instances (except for `add`?)
* Non-saturday/sunday weekends
